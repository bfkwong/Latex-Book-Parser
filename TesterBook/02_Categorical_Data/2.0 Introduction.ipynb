    "Recall from Chapter 1 that a **categorical variable** is a variable that can take on one of a limited set of values (which are called _levels_). In this chapter, we will discuss ways to analyze categorical variables. Throughout this chapter, we use the Titanic data set as a working example. This data set contains information about all of the people who were aboard the RMS Titanic when it sank in 1912, including both passengers and crew. Let's start by reading in this data set."

In order for a variable to be categorical, it must take on a _limited_ set of values, ideally with each level appearing multiple times in the data set. Otherwise, the analyses that we describe in this chapter will not be very meaningful."
