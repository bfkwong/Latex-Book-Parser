    "What does data look like? For most people, the first image that comes to mind is a spreadsheet, where each row represents something being measured and each column a type of measurement. This stereotype exists for a reason; many real-world data sets can indeed be organized this way. Data that can be represented using rows and columns is called _tabular data_. The rows are also called _observations_ or _records_,  while the columns are called _variables_ or _fields_. The different terms reflect the diverse communities within data science, and their origins are summarized in the table below.\n",

    "Within Python, tabular data is typically stored in \n",
    "a special type of object called a `DataFrame`. A `DataFrame` is optimized for storing tabular data; for example, it uses the fact that the values within a column are all the same type to save memory and speed up computations. Unfortunately, the `DataFrame` is not built into base Python, a reminder that Python is a general-purpose programming language. To be able to work with `DataFrame`s, we have to import a data science package called `pandas`, which essentially does one thing---define a data structure called a `DataFrame` for storing tabular data. But this data structure is so fundamental to data science that importing `pandas` is the very first line of many Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts:"
